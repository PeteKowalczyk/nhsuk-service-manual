  <h3>Ranganathan’s five laws of library science (1932)</h3>
  <p>Information architecture is not new and has its roots in library science. What happens if we replace the word ‘book’ in Ranganathan’s Five Laws with ‘article’ and ‘library’ with ‘website’?</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Books are for use.</li>
    <li>Every reader his or her book.</li>
    <li>Every book its reader.</li>
    <li>Save the time of the reader.</li>
    <li>The library must be a growing organism.</li>
  </ol>
