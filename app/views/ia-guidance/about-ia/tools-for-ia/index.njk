  <h3>Optimal workshop</h3>
  <p><a href="https://www.optimalworkshop.com/">Optimal workshop</a> is a tool that can be used to do remote testing of your IA through methods such as card sorts and tree tests.</p>
  <p>Research platforms such as this allow you to set-up, run and analyse tests to better understand your users' mental models through card sorting.</p>
  <p>Optimal workshop can also facilitate testing of candidate IA sitemaps. This means you can test both your old, and new sitemaos (where appropriate) to understand whether your new structures are performing better.</p>
