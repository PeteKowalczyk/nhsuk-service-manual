<h2 id="working-in-the-open">Working in the open</h2>
<p>The community backlog lives in the open using project boards on GitHub. Project boards on GitHub are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board">Kanban boards</a>. They help organise and prioritise the community backlog. We have 3 project boards:</p>

<ul class="nhsuk-list">

<h2 id="ways-contribute">Ways to contribute</h2>
<p>There are lots of different ways you can contribute to the service manual, small or big. For example, you can:</p>

  <li>
    <a href="/community-and-contribution/feedback-or-share-insights">
    Feedback or share insights</a>
    - to help improve things for everyone
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you can't find something in the service manual or community backlog, you have two options:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <a href="/community-and-contribution/propose-a-new-thing">
    Propose a new feature</a>
    - if you have an idea for the service manual
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/community-and-contribution/work-on-something">

    - if you want to do the work yourself and contribute it back to the service manual
  </li>
</ol>
