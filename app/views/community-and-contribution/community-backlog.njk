<h2 id="working-in-the-open">Working in the open</h2>
<p>The community backlog lives in the open using project boards on GitHub .</p>
<p>Project boards on GitHub are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board">Kanban boards</a>. They help organise and prioritise the community backlog. We have 3 project boards:</p>

<ul class="nhsuk-list">

<p>Feedback or share insights on something to help us improve things for everyone. To feedback or share insights, you need to:</p>

<h4 class="nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-3">1. Find the thing in the backlog</h4>
<p>Choose one of the <a href="#working-in-the-open">project boards</a> and use the search to quickly find a thing.</p>
