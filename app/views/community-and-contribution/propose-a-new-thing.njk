  <h2 id="check-the-community-backlog">Check the community backlog</h2>
  <p>The first thing to do is check if your idea is already in the <a href="/community-and-contribution/community-backlog">community backlog</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="if-it-has-been-proposed">If the idea is in the backlog</h3>
  <p>Please add any examples or evidence you have to support the proposal.</p>
  <p>Evidence could be screenshots or links to versions in different services.</p>

  <h3 id="if-it-has-been-proposed">If your idea is not in the backlog</h3>
  <p>You can <a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-backlog/issues/new">propose a new thing using a GitHub template</a>.</p>
  <p>At this stage, you just need to present your idea and evidence of user needs.</p>
  <p>The service manual team will review your proposal and see if it meets the <a href="/community-and-contribution/contribution-criteria">contribution criteria</a>.</p>
  <p>Once the proposal is ready to be worked on, it will be marked as "To do" in the backlog.</p>
  <p>You can choose to <a href="/community-and-contribution/work-on-something">work on the thing</a> yourself, or leave it for someone else.</p>
